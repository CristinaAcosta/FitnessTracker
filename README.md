## Links:

Repo: https://github.com/CristinaAcosta/ecommerce

## Description:

Here I created a site that tracks your workouts. You can add a cardio/resistance workout and continue this as well. The user will also see a stats page with previous workout that the user has accomplished.

## Technologies Used:

- HTML/CSS
- MongoDB

## Things we learned:

- I had a reall challenge with MongoDB installing out my computer and it still doesnt really work. This led to me having issues on the stats page.Heroku was also giving me issues where it would work then not work when being deployed.
